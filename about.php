        <p>
        Forest canopies are one of the most important parts of the environment, but they’re often ignored.

        They’re home to over half of all forest species and play a big role in fighting climate change by storing carbon and keeping ecosystems balanced.

        This site was made to focus on the canopy, what it is, why it matters, and how people can learn more about it.

        Even small awareness can lead to change.
